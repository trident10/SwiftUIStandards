# 🔧 Refactor: Modularize GraphQL Schema Architecture

## Overview
Refactored the monolithic GraphQL schema into a modular, feature-based architecture to improve maintainability and enable independent team development.

## Changes Made

### Schema Architecture
- **Introduced `Root.graphqls`**: Defines the base Query type with `_empty` field (required as GraphQL doesn't support truly empty Query types)
- **Created modular schema files**: 
  - `FeatureType.graphqls` - Feature-specific type definitions
  - `FeatureQuery.graphqls` - Feature-specific query definitions
- **Organized operations**: Centralized client-consumable queries in dedicated operations directory

### Features Implemented

**Payee Management**
- ✅ Refactored existing Payee functionality to new modular system
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility

**Account Management** 
- ✨ **NEW**: Added Account feature with full CRUD operations

**Payment Validation**
- ✨ **NEW**: Added PaymentValidation feature for real-time payment verification

### Operations Added/Updated

| Operation | Status | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `GetSavedPayees` | Refactored | Retrieve user's saved payees |
| `GetSavedPayeeWithUserAccounts` | **NEW** | Payment details screen data |
| `ValidatePayment` | **NEW** | Payment validation for details screen |

## Benefits
- 🏗️ **Improved maintainability**: Feature-based organization
- 👥 **Team independence**: Teams can work on their respective schemas without conflicts
- 📈 **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without touching core schema
- 🔍 **Better discoverability**: Clear separation of concerns

## Testing & Validation
- ✅ **Apollo iOS CLI Validation**: Tested schema composition and operations using `apollo-ios-cli`
- ✅ **Schema Validation**: Fixed all GraphQL validation errors before PR submission
- ✅ **Code Generation**: Verified Apollo code generation works correctly with new modular structure
- [ ] Existing Payee operations function correctly
- [ ] New Account operations work as expected  
- [ ] Payment validation returns appropriate responses
- [ ] End-to-end iOS client integration testing

## Breaking Changes
None - all existing operations maintain backward compatibility.

## Apollo iOS CLI Commands Used
```bash
# Schema validation and composition
apollo-ios-cli generate --schema-search-paths="./schema" --operations-search-paths="./operations"

# Validated all operations compile successfully
apollo-ios-cli validate --schema-search-paths="./schema" --operations-search-paths="./operations"
```

---
*This refactoring sets the foundation for scalable GraphQL schema management across multiple teams and features, with full Apollo iOS toolchain compatibility.*
