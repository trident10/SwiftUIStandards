GraphQL Integration Guide: Simplified
Here's a simplified approach to integrating GraphQL with Apollo Client while keeping your feature kits completely independent from Apollo:
1. Keep Apollo Only in API Core Kit

Add Apollo Client as a private dependency only in your API Core Kit
Create a simple interface for GraphQL operations that doesn't expose Apollo details
Feature kits will only work with strings and dictionaries, not Apollo types

2. Feature-Specific GraphQL Documents

Store GraphQL query strings directly in each feature kit (Home, Profile, Settings)
No Apollo code generation needed in feature kits
Example: HomeGraphQLDocuments.feedQuery = "query HomeFeedItems { ... }"

3. Create a Clean Interface

Make a protocol-based API that hides Apollo implementation details
Feature kits define requests with strings and transform dictionaries to models
API Core Kit handles all Apollo-specific code internally

4. Easy Testing and Future Changes

Test feature kits with simple mock responses (dictionaries)
If you need to replace Apollo later, only the API Core Kit needs changes
Feature kits and your main app remain untouched

Implementation in Three Parts

API Core Kit Updates:

Add Apollo dependencies
Create a protocol-based interface for GraphQL operations
Implement Apollo-specific code behind this interface


Feature Kit Changes:

Define GraphQL operations as simple strings
Create request objects that implement your protocol
Provide transformers to convert response data to domain models


ViewModel Integration:

ViewModels call the same API regardless of GraphQL or REST
Example: homeAPI.fetchHomeFeed { result in ... }



This approach gives you the benefits of GraphQL through Apollo while protecting your codebase from being locked into Apollo's specific implementation.
